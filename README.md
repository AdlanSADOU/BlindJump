# BlindJump

This game was our first year final project!
It was originaly made by Evan Bowman in c++.

We rewrote the entire game in plain C99 on Linux.

- Use `Makefile` to build this on Linux, you'll have to link (C)SFML yourself, it needs to be updated to use the CSFML library included under `/vendor/CSFML/`. 
- Use `build.bat` to build on Windows.
